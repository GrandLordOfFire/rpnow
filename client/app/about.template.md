# About RPNow

Gather up your friends &mdash; it's time to go on an adventure! Give your story a title, name your characters, customize their colors, and start writing together!

That's what RPNow is all about. **[RPNow](https://rpnow.net/) is the Dead-Simple Roleplay Chatroom Service.** It is the _only_ roleplay site that requires no user registration, supports multiple characters per user, keeps your roleplays permanently, and allows you to download the complete transcripts as text files at any time.

Simply put, it's the best place on the web to start your next RP.
