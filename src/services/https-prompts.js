If you are hosting this server on your home computer (and it is
therefore probably not reachable through the public Internet) then
HTTPS will not work, so you should not use it.

However, if your server is hosted in the cloud (or is otherwise
available on the public Internet) then it is highly recommended to
use HTTPS to keep this server secure. This requires that your server
has a domain name!

So, will you use HTTPS?`
