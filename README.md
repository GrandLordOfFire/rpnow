# Welcome to RPNow!

RPNow is a self-hosted, web-based roleplay chat website.

(TODO: add a GIF here!)

There is currently a canonical instance hosted at [rpnow.net](https://rpnow.net), however it is planned to be taken down sometime in the next few months. At that point, RPNow will become purely self-hosted software. (Steps will be taken to ensure that users can back up their RP's from rpnow.net and move them to their own sites!)


# Running RPNow

For non-technical users, [there is a helpful guide here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wN3TK5f2MDp9_q_U_8H2GknMNxxw8wX2Bk-0OMVbkGU/edit?usp=sharing)

However, if you're already familiar with node.js, simply clone this repo and run `npm install` and `npm start`.


# Contributing

The project is currently in a state of transition to make it more suitable to easy self-hosting. It will hopefully become more accessible to new contributors as well.

For more information on how the project works, see the [project wiki](https://github.com/rpnow/rpnow/wiki).
